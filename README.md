# Digit Recognition
Handwriting recognition of numeric digits with TensorFlowJS

## Motivation
* To get going with TensorFlowJS
* Explore scope of ML for the web

## Built With
* [TensorFlow.JS](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) - library for machine learning in JavaScript
* [Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io/) - Material Design look and feel

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

## TODO
- [x] Make drawing canvas resizable
- [ ] Make predictions more accurate
- [x] Create new UI
- [ ] Add chart data for predictions
- [ ] Train model with wrong predictions

## Inspired from 
[Benson Ruan](https://bensonruan.com/)'s work

## NOTE
There are times when the prediction shown is utterly wrong. Pardon my basic ML skills!
<br>Need to train the/use a better model.
